# User imputs two numbers, one number is assigned to a variable, the other number is assisgned to another variable.
# The task is to import two variables, so that the first variable contains the second number, while the first number is
# in the second varialble.


# code here

# a = int(input('Imput value a: '))
# b = int(input('Input value b: '))

# a = 5, b = 10
# print(f'a = {a}, b = {b}')

# O(1)
# temp = a # 10
# a = b # 5
# b = temp # 5

# a, b = b, a

# a = 5, b = 10
#a = a + b # 5 + 10 = 15
#b = a - b # 15 - 10 = 5
#a = a - b # 10 - 5 = 5

#print(f'a = {a}, b = {b}')
